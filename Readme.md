<!-- run online end -->


<p>This example demonstrates how to upload an Excel file from your computer to the server using <strong>UploadControl</strong> and then display its data in <strong>GridView</strong>.<br><br>For this purpose, save a file uploaded via UploadedControl in its CallbackRouteValues controller action and pass the saved file's path to the client side by using the e.CallbackData parameter. Then, obtain this path in the UploadControl's client-sideÂ <a href="https://documentation.devexpress.com/#AspNet/DevExpressWebScriptsASPxClientUploadControl_FileUploadCompletetopic">FileUploadComplete</a> event handler and initiate GridView's callback in order to show the uploaded file's data in the grid:</p>


```cs
    settings.ClientSideEvents.FileUploadComplete = "function(s, e) { GridView1.PerformCallback({ path: e.callbackData}); }";
```


<p>To show the Excel file's data in GridView, you can use the approach illustrated in theÂ <a href="https://www.devexpress.com/Support/Center/p/E4458">How to bind GridView with Excel file</a> example.</p>
